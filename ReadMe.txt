Dalton Port City Plan 

By Modhunter

A fishing village, that grew to became a trade port.
Much like Mitch, they're heavy drinkers. Some even go for coffee...

Conqueror support: Armoury, Mess Hall, Training Yard, (Artillery Post), Distillery.
Like most of Far Harbour, powered by Wind.

General: Full pathing (some of windtower not verified), Player home (Intentionally not NPC accessible), bathroom & showers.
Plots: 13 Residential, 3 Each, Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial (2Adv), Martial, Recreational.
Minor positive net income @L3 (other levels untested).

Produces wood>coal>flares, oil, fish (food), beer>booze & lots of happiness.
I expect no upgrading issues.  Enough of everything, plenty of happiness.
